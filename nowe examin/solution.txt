Thought for 25s

Gotcha—you’ve got a Sumo query that slices test logs every 15m and breaks counts out by testtext, filtered to a specific processor name. Here’s how to build the equivalent in Datadog using logs + a dashboard widget.

Quick note: your Sumo query has a few typos (“txld/txid”, “transponse/transpose”, smart quotes). I’m assuming the intent is: parse fields ➜ enrich processor name ➜ filter to a processor ➜ count by testtext over 15m and show each testtext as its own series.

1) Make sure the logs carry the right tags/attributes

In Datadog, you’ll want tags/attributes roughly equivalent to:

env:prod (or similar)

collector:example-aws-prod (maps your _collector)

service:testserver (maps your _sourceName)

raw message contains XML-like fragments: <testProcessor>…</testProcessor>, <testText>…</testText>, <AcceptorName>…</AcceptorName>

a transaction id field, e.g. txid (from log.mdc.transactionId)

2) Create a Log Pipeline to parse + enrich

Datadog → Logs → Configuration → Pipelines → “New Pipeline”, then add processors:

a) XML/Grok parser to extract fields

If your message is XML-ish inside a string, a Grok parser works well:

Grok Parser

Rule name: parse_test_xml

Grok pattern:
<%{DATA:xml_tag}>(?:%{DATA:tmp})?</%{DATA:end_tag}>


…but that’s too generic. Better to add explicit extractions with multiple rules:

Rule 1:
<GUID>%{DATA:txid}</GUID>|"log.mdc.transactionId"%{SPACE}:%{SPACE}"%{DATA:txid}"

Rule 2:
<testProcessor>%{DATA:testprocessor}</testProcessor>

Rule 3:
<testText>%{DATA:testtext}</testText>

Rule 4:
<AcceptorName>%{DATA:acceptorName}</AcceptorName>


(Adjust Rule 1 to match wherever log.mdc.transactionId appears—JSON, MDC, etc. If your logs are valid JSON, use the JSON Parser first, then a Remapper to map log.mdc.transactionId → @txid.)

Make sure parsed fields end up as attributes: @txid, @testprocessor, @testtext, @acceptorName.

b) Normalize/clean testtext like your Sumo if(...)

Add a Category Processor (or Compute Processor) to coerce anything containing “test CODE” to APPROVED.

Category Processor

Input: @testtext

Category list:

Match: *test CODE* → Output value: APPROVED

“Use category value to replace the processed attribute”: ON

(Alternative: Compute a new attribute @testtext_norm and use that downstream.)

c) Lookup processor to map processor id → name

Prepare a small CSV (Datadog Lookup Processor accepts uploaded tables):

testprocessor_lookup.csv

testprocessorid,testprocessorname
123,test and example
456,Other Processor
...


Lookup Processor

Input field: @testprocessor (your id)

Target field: @testprocessorname

Lookup table: upload testprocessor_lookup.csv

d) (Optional) Remap service/tags

Add a Service Remapper or Tag Remapper so you can query with:

service:testserver

collector:example-aws-prod

e) Create facets

In Logs → Configuration → Facets, add facets for @testtext and @testprocessorname (this speeds up splitting/filters).

3) Build the dashboard widget (15m timeseries, split by testtext)

Datadog → Dashboards → New Dashboard → “Add Widget” → Timeseries → Logs query:

Search:

collector:example-aws-prod service:testserver @testprocessorname:"test and example"


(Adjust to your actual tag keys if different—e.g., source:testserver.)

Measure: count()

Group by: @testtext

Roll-up/Interval: 15m

Display: “Split by” series (so each testtext bexamplees a separate line). Choose “Stacked” if you prefer stacked areas/bars.

This reproduces:

timeslice 15m
| count by testtext
| transpose row=_timeslice column=testtext


(“Transpose” in Sumo is equivalent to “split by” in Datadog’s timeseries.)

4) (Optional) Add companion widgets

Top List (last 1h) — top @testtext by count().

Query Value — total count() over last 15m with same filters.

Table — group by @testtext, show count() and pct_of_total().

5) Notes on “transactionize”

Sumo’s transactionize txid maxSpan=1m (merge …) is primarily for stitching multi-line / multi-event flows by txid. For the graph you want (counts by testtext), you usually don’t need transactionization in Datadog—just ensure each log carries @testtext.
If you truly need multi-line merge for context, consider:

Enabling multi-line log handling at intake (for stack traces).

Or moving this flow to APM traces and using txid as a trace/span tag (then you can build service dashboards over traces). But again, for counts by testtext, it’s not required.

Copy/paste snippets

Lookup CSV stub

testprocessorid,testprocessorname
123,test and example


Grok examples (tune to your log format)

<testProcessor>%{DATA:testprocessor}</testProcessor>
<testText>%{DATA:testtext}</testText>
<AcceptorName>%{DATA:acceptorName}</AcceptorName>


Log search filter (dashboard widget)

collector:example-aws-prod service:testserver @testprocessorname:"test and example"


That’s it—once the pipeline is parsing/enriching, your timeseries will match what Sumo produced: one line per testtext, counted every 15 minutes, filtered to the processor you care about. If you want, I can draft the exact pipeline JSON export and a dashboard JSON you can import directly.

You said:
can you explain Rule name: parse_test_xml

Grok pattern:
<%{DATA:xml_tag}>(?:%{DATA:tmp})?</%{DATA:end_tag}>
…but that’s too generic. Better to add explicit extractions with multiple rules:

javascript
Copy code
Rule 1:
<GUID>%{DATA:txid}</GUID>|"log.mdc.transactionId"%{SPACE}:%{SPACE}"%{DATA:txid}"

Rule 2:
<testProcessor>%{DATA:testprocessor}</testProcessor>

Rule 3:
<testText>%{DATA:testtext}</testText>

Rule 4:
<AcceptorName>%{DATA:acceptorName}</AcceptorName>
(Adjust Rule 1 to match wherever log.mdc.transactionId appears—JSON, MDC, etc. If your logs are valid JSON, use the JSON Parser first, then a Remapper to map log.mdc.transactionId → @txid.)

Make sure parsed fields end up as attributes: @txid, @testprocessor, @testtext, @acceptorName.

b) Normalize/clean testtext like your Sumo if(...)
Add a Category Processor (or Compute Processor) to coerce anything containing “test CODE” to APPROVED.

Category Processor

Input: @testtext

Category list:

Match: *test CODE* → Output value: APPROVED

“Use category value to replace the processed attribute”: ON

(Alternative: Compute a new attribute @testtext_norm and use that downstream.)

c) Lookup processor to map processor id → name

ChatGPT said:

Totally—here’s what each piece is doing, why, and how to wire it up cleanly in Datadog.

A) Grok parsing: what those rules mean
The “too generic” pattern

<%{DATA:xml_tag}>(?:%{DATA:tmp})?</%{DATA:end_tag}>

< … >: looking for XML-like tags.

%{DATA:xml_tag}: capture any characters (greedy) up to > as the opening tag name → xml_tag.

(?:%{DATA:tmp})?: optionally capture the content between the tags into tmp.

</%{DATA:end_tag}>: capture the closing tag name → end_tag.

Why it’s “too generic”:
It matches any tag pair and doesn’t ensure the open and close names match (e.g., <A>…</B> would still match). It also doesn’t yield the specific fields you care about (testtext, etc.), so you end up post-filtering a big blob.

Prefer explicit rules (one per field)

These are focused patterns that pull exactly the attributes you want.

Rule 1 (transaction id):
<GUID>%{DATA:txid}</GUID>|"log.mdc.transactionId"%{SPACE}:%{SPACE}"%{DATA:txid}"

The | means “match either the left or the right”.

Left side handles XML-ish logs: <GUID>…</GUID> → capture the contents as txid.

Right side handles JSON/kv-ish logs: "log.mdc.transactionId" : "…".

%{SPACE} matches whitespace so you’re resilient to spaces after :.

%{DATA:txid} grabs everything up to the closing ". (If your txid can contain quotes, switch to a more precise pattern.)

Rule 2 (processor id):
<testProcessor>%{DATA:testprocessor}</testProcessor>

Captures the value between those tags into testprocessor.

Rule 3 (test text):
<testText>%{DATA:testtext}</testText>

Captures the message/decision text into testtext.

Rule 4 (acceptor name):
<AcceptorName>%{DATA:acceptorName}</AcceptorName>

Captures merchant/acceptor name.

Tips to make these reliable

Use non-greedy when needed: %{GREEDYDATA} is greedy; %{DATA} stops at next delimiter. With well-formed tags, %{DATA} is fine.

If content can contain newlines, enable “extract across multiple lines” or use %{GREEDYDATA} and ensure your intake merges multiline logs.

If the XML can have spaces (<testText >), allow optional space: <testText\s*>%{DATA:testtext}</testText\s*>.

Order matters: put the JSON Parser first if your message is JSON; then Grok only for the XML fragment embedded in a field (e.g., @message).

B) Making attributes in Datadog (what ends up where)

When you create Grok rules in a Log Pipeline → Grok Parser, captured fields bexamplee log attributes automatically, typically accessible as @txid, @testprocessor, @testtext, @acceptorName.
Good hygiene:

Add Facets for @testtext and @testprocessorname (after lookup) to filter/split quickly.

If your txid should be searchable, consider a tag remapper to also copy it into a tag (e.g., txid:<value>), but only if cardinality won’t explode.

C) Normalizing testtext (Category or Compute)

Goal: turn any testtext containing “test CODE” into APPROVED so you can group by a single clean value.

Category Processor

Input attribute: @testtext

Rule: *test CODE* → APPROVED

“Use category value to replace the processed attribute”: ON
Effect: @testtext itself gets overwritten to APPROVED when it matches.

Alternative: Compute Processor

Create a new attribute @testtext_norm with:

If @testtext contains “test CODE” → APPROVED

Else → @testtext
Use @testtext_norm for dashboards to avoid mutating the original.

Matching details

Category processor uses wildcard matching; it’s case-sensitive by default. If your logs vary in casing (“test Code”), add additional patterns or normalize first with a lowercase processor + match *test code*.

D) Lookup Processor (id → name)

You want to map the parsed testprocessor (id) to a friendly name.

Prepare a CSV (first row are column headers):

testprocessorid,testprocessorname
123,test and example
456,Other Processor


In the Lookup Processor:

Input field: @testprocessor

Lookup table: upload the CSV (Datadog stores it as a reference table)

Output/Target field: @testprocessorname

“No match behavior”: choose whether to keep the original, set a default, or leave empty. I like setting @testprocessorname to unknown for downstream filters.

Good practices

Keep keys string-consistent (no hidden spaces). If your ids are numeric in logs, make sure the CSV has the same representation.

Re-upload when the mapping changes; Datadog applies it to future logs.

E) JSON logs path (if your message is JSON)

If the logs are valid JSON with log.mdc.transactionId:

JSON Parser first → this promotes JSON keys to attributes, e.g. @log.mdc.transactionId.

Remapper to set @txid from @log.mdc.transactionId.

Keep the Grok parser but point it at the field that has the XML fragment (e.g., @message), not the whole raw log.

F) End-to-end example

Sample log:

... service=testserver collector=example-aws-prod message="<testProcessor>123</testProcessor><testText>test CODE 918273</testText><AcceptorName>ACME LTD</AcceptorName>"
{"log":{"mdc":{"transactionId":"7d9f-abc-42"}}}


After pipeline:

@txid = 7d9f-abc-42

@testprocessor = 123

@testtext (after Category) = APPROVED

@acceptorName = ACME LTD

Lookup → @testprocessorname = test and example (if 123 maps)

Your dashboard query:

collector:example-aws-prod service:testserver @testprocessorname:"test and example"


Timeseries:

Measure: count()

Group by: @testtext (or @testtext_norm)

Interval: 15m

G) Common pitfalls to avoid

Greedy matches swallowing multiple tags. If you see empty fields or huge captures, switch %{DATA} ↔ %{GREEDYDATA} thoughtfully and/or anchor more precisely.

Case sensitivity in Category rules—add variants or normalize case first.

Cardinality blow-ups (e.g., using full free-form messages as tags). Keep high-cardinality values as attributes, not tags.

Lookup key mismatches (extra spaces, leading zeros). Normalize both inputs and CSV.

If you paste me a representative raw log line (or two), I’ll tailor the exact Grok patterns and the pipeline step order so you can copy/paste into Datadog.

You said:
datadog allowing usage only on processor in this case eather processod _>into processorname
and testcode into _processorcodevalu what is solution to resolveit
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 29s

Got it — you want two separate enrichments but Datadog seems to let you “use only one processor”:

map testprocessor → processorname, and

normalize/map test text/code → _processorcodevalue.

Here are practical ways to do it in Datadog logs pipelines:

Option A — Chain processors (preferred)

You can have multiple processors in one pipeline; just order them top→bottom.

Parse (Grok/JSON) → create @testprocessor, @testtext.

Category (or Compute) Processor → build your code value:

Input: @testtext

Match: *test CODE* → Output: APPROVED

Target attribute: @processorcodevalue (don’t overwrite @testtext unless you want to)

Lookup Processor → map @testprocessor to a friendly name:

Reference Table key: testprocessorid

Output / target attribute: @processorname

Now your dashboard can group by @processorcodevalue and filter on @processorname. Datadog supports multiple processors in order; the pipeline runs them sequentially.

Option B — One Lookup → multiple outputs (if your admin limits processor count)

Put both outputs in a single lookup:

Build a Reference Table with columns for everything you need:

testprocessorid,processorname,processorcodevalue_default
123,test and example,APPROVED
456,Other Processor,DECLINED


In the Lookup Processor, set:

Input: @testprocessor

Target prefix (UI: “target attribute path prefix”), e.g. @enrich

Datadog will add attributes like:

@enrich.processorname

@enrich.processorcodevalue_default

(Optional) Remapper to copy them to your final names:

@enrich.processorname → @processorname

@enrich.processorcodevalue_default → @processorcodevalue

This lets one lookup populate several attributes from the table.

Datadog

Option C — No lookup for code value

If processor code is derivable from the text itself (e.g., contains “test CODE” → APPROVED), skip the lookup for that and rely on a Category/Compute processor to set @processorcodevalue. Use the lookup only for the processor name. 
Datadog Monitoring

Minimal, copyable setup (Option A)

Category processor

Input: @testtext

Rules: *test CODE* → APPROVED

Target attribute: @processorcodevalue

“Replace processed attribute”: OFF

Lookup processor

Input field: @testprocessor

Reference Table: (key=testprocessorid, column=processorname)

Target attribute: @processorname

No-match behavior: set default (e.g., unknown)

This approach is simple, avoids collisions, and works even if you’re only “allowed” one lookup. If your space truly enforces one processor total, use Option B to have a single lookup emit multiple attributes, then remap.

To convert the provided Sumo Logic query to a Datadog query and use it in a Datadog dashboard, we need to adapt the query to Datadog's log processing pipeline, query syntax, and dashboard capabilities. The Sumo Logic query processes XML logs, extracts fields, applies conditional logic, performs a lookup, and aggregates data for visualization. Below, I’ll outline the steps to achieve this in Datadog, including how to set up a Grok parser for the XML logs, create a query, and visualize the results in a dashboard. Since you mentioned a parser has been created with %data:xml and two example logs, I’ll assume the logs contain XML data with fields like <testProcessor>, <testText>, and <AcceptorName>, and I’ll guide you on using them in a dashboard.

Step 1: Understand the Sumo Logic Query
The Sumo Logic query does the following:

Filters Logs: Selects logs from _collector=example-aws-prod and _sourceName=ahserver containing <testProcessor> or <testText>.
JSON Parsing: Extracts log.mdc.transactionld as txid.
Transaction Grouping: Groups logs by txid within a 1-minute span, merging _raw logs with newlines.
XML Parsing: Extracts testprocessor, testtext, and acceptorName from XML fields.
Conditional Logic: Maps testtext values to simplified categories (e.g., "APPROVED", "INVALID", "EXPIRED", "SIMULATED", "DECLINED") based on content.
Filtering: Keeps logs where testtext is non-empty.
Lookup: Maps testprocessor to testprocessorname using a lookup table.
Filtering: Filters for testprocessorname containing "test and example".
Aggregation: Groups by 15-minute time slices and testtext, counting occurrences.
Visualization: Transposes the results into a table with _timeslice as rows and testtext as columns.


Step 2: Set Up the Grok Parser in Ascertain in Datadog
Since you’ve indicated that a parser with %data:xml has been created, I’ll assume it’s a Datadog Grok parser configured to parse XML fields. However, to ensure clarity, let’s define a Grok parser to extract the required fields (testprocessor, testtext, acceptorName) from the XML logs.
Example Logs (Assumed)
Based on the query, the logs likely look something like this (since example logs weren’t provided, I’m inferring the structure):
text2025-09-05 12:00:00 {"log.mdc.transactionld": "12345"} <testProcessor>PROC123</testProcessor><testText>APPROVED test CODE: XYZ</testText><AcceptorName>MerchantA</AcceptorName>
2025-09-05 12:00:30 {"log.mdc.transactionld": "12345"} <testText>DECLINE PICKUP CARD</testText><AcceptorName>MerchantB</AcceptorName>
Creating the Grok Parser

Navigate to Datadog Log Pipelines:

Go to Logs > Configuration > Pipelines in Datadog.
Create a new pipeline or edit the existing one with %data:xml.


Define Grok Parsing Rules:

Since the logs contain JSON (log.mdc.transactionld) and XML (<testProcessor>, <testText>, <AcceptorName>), we’ll use a combination of processors.
Add a Parse JSON processor to extract log.mdc.transactionld as txid:

Source field: message (or wherever the JSON is in the log).
Output: txid (maps to log.mdc.transactionld).


Add a Grok Parser to extract XML fields:

Grok pattern:
text%{data:testprocessor:xml} %{data:testtext:xml} %{data:acceptorName:xml}

This assumes the %data:xml parser is already set up to parse XML tags into attributes. If not, you can use a specific pattern like:
text<testProcessor>%{data:testprocessor}</testProcessor>.*<testText>%{data:testtext}</testText>.*<AcceptorName>%{data:acceptorName}</AcceptorName>

Test with sample logs to ensure fields are extracted correctly (e.g., testprocessor=PROC123, testtext=APPROVED test CODE: XYZ, acceptorName=MerchantA).




Add Conditional Logic for testtext:

Datadog doesn’t have direct equivalents to Sumo Logic’s if statements, but you can use a Remap Processor or Grok Parser with conditional logic.
Add a Grok Parser to remap testtext values:
text%{regex(".*test CODE.*"):testtext:APPROVED}|%{regex(".*INVALID.*"):testtext:INVALID}|%{regex(".*EXPIRED.*"):testtext:EXPIRED}|%{regex(".*SIMULATED.*"):testtext:SIMULATED}|%{regex(".*(DECLINE|DECL PICKUP CARD).*"):testtext:DECLINED}

This creates a new testtext attribute with values like APPROVED, INVALID, etc., based on the original testtext content.


Add a Filter Processor to exclude logs where testtext is empty:

Filter query: @testtext:*




Save and Test:

Use the sample logs to test the pipeline.
Ensure txid, testprocessor, testtext, and acceptorName are extracted as attributes in the Log Explorer.




Step 3: Handle Lookup in Datadog
Sumo Logic’s lookup operator maps testprocessor to testprocessorname using a lookup table (lookups/testprocessor). Datadog supports lookups via Reference Tables.

Create a Reference Table:

Go to Logs > Configuration > Reference Tables.
Create a new table named testprocessor_lookup.
Upload a CSV or manually enter data with columns testprocessorid and testprocessorname (e.g., PROC123,TestProcessor).
Set testprocessorid as the primary key.


Add Lookup Processor:

In the pipeline, add a Lookup Processor after the Grok parser.
Source attribute: testprocessor.
Reference Table: testprocessor_lookup.
Output attribute: testprocessorname.
This enriches logs with testprocessorname based on testprocessor.


Filter by testprocessorname:

Add a Filter Processor:

Query: @testprocessorname:*test*example*
This filters for testprocessorname containing "test and example" (interpreted as a substring match, e.g., test or example).






Step 4: Handle Transaction Grouping
Sumo Logic’s transactionize groups logs by txid within a 1-minute window, merging _raw with newlines. Datadog doesn’t have a direct transactionize equivalent, but you can approximate it using log queries or custom processing.

Option 1: Use Log Query Grouping:

In the Log Explorer, group logs by txid and aggregate _raw messages.
This doesn’t merge with newlines but can be visualized in dashboards.


Option 2: Custom Processor:

Use a Custom Processor with a script to concatenate _raw messages per txid within a 1-minute window. This requires advanced scripting and may not be necessary for dashboard purposes unless specific formatting is needed.



For simplicity, we’ll proceed with grouping in the query (Step 5).

Step 5: Create the Datadog Query
In Datadog’s Log Explorer, construct a query to replicate the Sumo Logic aggregation and filtering:

Base Query:

Filter logs by source and content:
text@collector:example-aws-prod @sourceName:ahserver @testprocessor:* @testtext:*

This matches _collector=example-aws-prod, _sourceName=ahserver, and logs containing <testProcessor> or <testText>.


Filter by testprocessorname:

Add to the query:
text@testprocessorname:*test*example*



Group and Aggregate:

Use the Group By feature in Log Explorer:

Group by: _timeslice (15m intervals) and testtext.
Aggregate: count (to count occurrences per group).


Query example:
text@collector:example-aws-prod @sourceName:ahserver @testprocessor:* @testtext:* @testprocessorname:*test*example* | timeslice 15m | count by _timeslice, testtext





Step 6: Create a Dashboard in Datadog
To visualize the results as a transposed table (like Sumo Logic’s transpose row _timeslice column testtext), use a Timeseries or Table widget:

Navigate to Dashboards:

Go to Dashboards > New Dashboard in Datadog.


Add a Widget:

Choose a Timeseries widget for time-based visualization or a Table widget for a transposed view.
For a Timeseries widget:

Query: Same as above (@collector:example-aws-prod @sourceName:ahserver @testprocessor:* @testtext:* @testprocessorname:*test*example*).
Group by: testtext.
Time aggregation: 15m.
Visualization: Stacked bars or lines to show counts of testtext values (e.g., APPROVED, DECLINED) over time.


For a Table widget:

Query: Same as above.
Pivot: _timeslice as rows, testtext as columns, and count as the value.
This mimics the transpose operation, showing counts of testtext categories per 15-minute time slice.




Save the Dashboard:

Add the widget to the dashboard and save.
Optionally, add template variables (e.g., for collector or sourceName) to make the dashboard dynamic.




Step 7: Notes and Limitations

Transaction Grouping: Datadog’s log grouping doesn’t merge _raw messages with newlines like Sumo Logic’s transactionize. If this is critical, you may need a custom processor or external scripting.
XML Parsing: Ensure the %data:xml parser correctly handles your XML structure. Test with the provided example logs to confirm fields are extracted accurately.
Performance: Large log volumes may require optimizing the pipeline (e.g., using index filters or sampling).
Lookup Table: Ensure the testprocessor_lookup table is populated with all possible testprocessorid values.


Example Dashboard Output
The dashboard will show:

Timeseries: A chart with lines or bars for each testtext value (e.g., APPROVED, DECLINED) over 15-minute intervals.
Table: A table with _timeslice (e.g., 2025-09-05 12:00:00) as rows and columns for each testtext value (e.g., APPROVED, INVALID), showing counts.
