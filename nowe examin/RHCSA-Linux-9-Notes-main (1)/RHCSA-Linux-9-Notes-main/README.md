# RHCSA-Linux-9-Notes


Hey! Welcome to NOtes RHCSA 9 Linux  ðŸ¤ 



As I prepare for the RHCSA 9 exam I will write down everything that I study. Feel free clone this repository and use it how you want. I also welcome pull requests if you want to add information.

I will continually keep adding to the table of contents and to the files listed as my study progresses so I recommend you come back later if you are also studying for the RHCSA or studying Linux in general.
