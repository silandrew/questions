# Interview Answers

## About the Role

### Technical Answers
1. **Experience with automating provisioning**: I have automated server and network provisioning in both physical environments and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. For example, I used Terraform to define infrastructure as code and Ansible to configure servers post-provisioning.
2. **Continuous Delivery pipelines**: I worked on a pipeline that automated the deployment of microservices. Using Jenkins and Docker, I ensured that builds, tests, and deployments were seamless and repeatable.
3. **Automating server and switch configuration**: I have used Ansible extensively to automate server configurations, including setting up users, installing packages, and configuring network interfaces. For switches, I used vendor-specific APIs and scripts.
4. **Interacting with vendors and institutions**: I maintained regular communication with hardware vendors to ensure timely delivery and support. For telecom providers, I negotiated contracts and ensured SLAs were met.
5. **Provisioning laptops and shipments**: I standardized the laptop provisioning process using scripts to install required software and configure settings. For shipments, I coordinated with logistics providers to ensure timely delivery.

### Coding Answers
6. **Preferred programming language**: Python is my preferred language. I used it to automate AWS resource management, such as creating EC2 instances and managing S3 buckets.
7. **Script for AWS server deployment**: I would use Boto3 to write a Python script that provisions an EC2 instance, attaches a security group, and installs necessary software.
8. **Log file parsing script**: Hereâ€™s an example:
   ```python
   with open("logfile.txt", "r") as file:
       for line in file:
           if "ERROR" in line:
               print(line)
   ```

### Behavioral Answers
9. **Taking initiative**: In my previous role, I identified inefficiencies in the deployment process and introduced a CI/CD pipeline, reducing deployment time by 50%.
10. **Staying motivated**: I stay motivated by setting personal learning goals, such as completing certifications or contributing to open-source projects.
11. **Managing 3rd parties**: I negotiated a hardware contract that saved the company 20% annually by comparing vendor quotes and leveraging relationships.
12. **Providing desktop support**: I prioritize tasks and use remote desktop tools to quickly resolve issues while ensuring other responsibilities are not neglected.

### Hypothetical Scenarios
13. **Setting up a new office network**: I would start by designing the network topology, provisioning hardware, and automating configurations using Ansible. Security measures like firewalls and VPNs would be implemented.
14. **Troubleshooting a critical server**: I would check logs, verify network connectivity, and use monitoring tools to identify the root cause. If needed, I would escalate to the cloud provider.
15. **Resolving remote laptop issues**: I would guide the employee through basic troubleshooting steps, use remote management tools, and, if necessary, arrange for a replacement device.
